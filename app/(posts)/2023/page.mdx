## Well well well well well...

We saw it all in 2023. A new champion on the trophy. The first time someone has won from the middle group. Sue playing right handed! More on that later...

The Village treated us superbly again, and after the sighter in 2022 we were welcomed back with open arms &ndash; like no time had passed at all!

The Milkshake Cup merch was looking absolutely regal in the September sunshine:

A big thank you to Josh for coordinating the shirts and to Tom for making the hats!

Out on the course, Sam got off to a fast start, but Harry was heating up with the putter. When these ones start dropping, it's easy to get the feeling that today could just be your day:

Things were looking tight at the turn, just 4 shots separating the top 5 on the leaderboard &mdash; and as we know, anything can happen at The Village!

Group 3 set off looking for a miracle. Jim was a long way back but he was feeling good, and had great company with Mike and Pin.

The middle group were looking a little happier. Harry only missed the top group by a shot, and Tom, well, you don't get all those stars on your chest by duffing it around in the Milkshake Cup!

The last group were hiding in the shade for the time being. Things were heating up at The Village!

Josh was feeling good after driving the green at the first, confident that he could reel Sam in, with only two shots the gap at the turn.

But a difficult start to the back 9 saw the challenge fade away...

The defending champion was right where he wanted to be: firmly in the mix, just needing a steady second round to give himself a chance.

But Alan's charge would fizzle out after a detour through some of the more densely wooded parts of the golf course (more on _that_ later too). Could Sue be the one to gain a bit of momentum and overhaul the leader?

Alas it wasn't to be for Sue either, with the aftorementioned righty situation (yes, really, more on that later) summing up the way the cookie was crumbling. Tough game, this!

Meanwhile, having throught he'd shaken off Josh after three holes, Sam had totally imploded, playing pinball behind the 6th green for a little bit too long, and then losing a ball with a wayward drive on the 7th. Reckless!

The 2023 Milkshake Cup seemed to be turning from a game of who would win into a test of nerve to see who could not lose it. But unbeknownst to the lead group, things were progressing serenely in the middle group, with both Tom and Harry finding some quality golf in the latter stages of the afternoon.

In the end though, Tom just couldn't find the magic required to earn his fifth (!) title, and as the scores were totted up, all eyes fell to dear Harold! It couldn't be, could it?

But yes! From four shots behind at the turn he'd come storming through the field to win by three! An extraordinary turnaround and the first time we've ever had a bolter from the middle group come through to lift the trophy!

Very, very, _very_ well played Harry. We all can't wait to prise the trophy out of your hands in 2024!

### A new award for 2024

Now, the 'more on that later' that I've been promising all this time: inspired by some of the less glamourous golf on display at times during the championship, Appin is introducing a new award in 2024!

The 'Name TBC Award' will go to the person who finds the unluckiest lie out there on the course this year. Photographic evidence is required to enter, and the winner takes home a sleeve of balls. Here's the pick of the bunch from 2023...

Sue plays righty:

But the judge's favourite from 2023: Alistair looking for a hiding place on the 8th hole!
