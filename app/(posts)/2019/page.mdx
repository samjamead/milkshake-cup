<AnnualWelcome name='T. R. Clements' year='2018' image={thomas}>
    The Milkshake Cup is the most prestigious event in the amateur golfing
    calendar. Strictly invite only, you should feel honoured to have been
    selected for this year's event. Winning the Milkshake Cup is one of my
    greatest achievements; lifting that famous trophy and being awarded the
    green waterproof jacket in McDonald's car park is truly a feeling like no
    other.

    Short drives, aggressive chipping, and slow bobbling putts are the key to
    success on these challenging courses. May the odds be ever in your favour!

</AnnualWelcome>

The 2019 edition of The Milkshake Cup was a tightly fought contest held in glorious September sunshine. Excitement reached fever-pitch as the competitors arrived at the course, with weeks of preparation culminating in first-tee jitters. Unanswered questions filled the nervous chatter. Why was it so <em>hot</em>?! Would H. P. Langdon's train be there on time? And even if he made it, would he be so hungover he wouldn't be able to putt straight?

In the end, we needn't have worried. Practice swings were swung, warmup putts were putted, handicap trash talk was plentiful, until a nervous hush descended on the group. At the 11 o'clock bell the defending champion strode to the tee to rapturous applause from the gallery.

"May the odds be ever in your favour", he offered, as parting advice to his fellow competitors. "Now keep your eyes on this one!"

With a swoosh and a divot, the champ wobbled one down there, safe and dry.
Phew! After the champ came the challengers: The Winning Sticks&#x2122; flashed
through the air, threatened the ball briefly, and were brandished
triumphantly. The championships were underway!

Three hours later it was looking very tight at the top of the leaderboard,
with only 3 shots separating TC, Alan, and Cristina after 14 holes. The
challenge from some of the pre-round favourites had faded. Josh, in pursuit of
a lighter bag on a hot day, had just a 7-iron as his longest club in the bag.
Looking for a few extra yards at the long 12th hole (225 yards on the card!)
he hoiked one out of bounds - a long way back into contention from there.

Playing in the final group, Harry's hangover finally got the better of him as
he faded after a promising start. Sam M left himself too much to do with a
front nine of 36, and even 25 on the back nine wasn't enough to recover.

With three holes to play, it was still looking close between our leading trio.
A bogey at the 17th hurt Cristina's challenge, leaving her needing a hole in
one at the last to force a playoff. A tidy par on 18 and fourth place overall
completed a very promising debut for the young Spaniard, and the field will
expect big things in 2020.

So then, to the last hole, and in fact, to the final putt of the championship.
After duelling back and forth all day, Alan and TC were tied for the lead on
the 18th tee... A fact that we only figured out later, in the pub, by the time
it was all too late to make a difference! (Note to self, add up the scores a
bit earlier next year. &mdash;<em>Ed.</em>)

Two good tee shots and two good chips had both competitors looking at
four-foot par putts; the ultimate knee-knocker when the famous trophy is on
the line. In the end the result was all too familiar! Poor old Al left a putt
for the half short, and tapped in for second place. The champion had
successfully defended! His reign of terror continues!

A more deserving champion you couldn't have found. A year of solid practice
(consisting of at least two rounds of golf) had lead to an unprecedented patch
of form. The six-hour drive down had barely left a scratch. He didn't even
notice that it was 15 degrees hotter in Devon than ont' moors. Thomas, we bow
down to your fortitude and strength!

The top of the leaderboard only told half the story. Further down, another
debutant was running away with the newly created non-golfer category; Greg
storming in with an excellent back nine of 28 net, and a low enough total for
joint-fourth overall! Very well played and a deserving graduation into the big
leagues for the 2020 edition.

Back in the pub, over a hard earned pint of chips, we heard the true story of
the 2019 Milkshake Cup. The mid-table grinders, trying in vain to reach the
dizzying heights occupied by Yorkshiremen and Yorkshiremen alone.

We heard of Williamson taking a full swing at a ball on the edge of a green,
only to end up 50 yards over the back of the putting surface. Oh, but what a
swing it is! Jim had holed three monster putts coming home, and finished his
back nine in with a highly respectable 32 net and second in the non-golfer
category. Alistair polished the winning sticks in every water hazard on the
course - twice in some of them - and has tucked them away safely for the 2021
outing. We will miss you in 2020, Al!

A special mention to Samuel S, who as well as scooping third place in the
non-golfer comp documented the day superbly, and his photos and videos tell
the real story of the championship. Thank you Samuel, and [enjoy the footage here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNDvoBtShf4RhXaq4UOYsWHmM5JWcxmYpLDGzD9madv3eR_49BKrtD5iCvfnAoxpA?key=SXhGT2NPNDN4TG5zQm5JaVh3NWQ1ZHJwRms0Y1JR)!

We'll see you all back next year for what promises to be another belter of a
Milkshake Cup. Can someone, anyone, absolutely anyone wipe that smug bastard
off the trophy?! We can't let him win three years in a row!
