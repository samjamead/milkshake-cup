## Saturday &mdash; The Milkshake Cup

This year we're heading to the glorious Gilling Castle Golf Club ([directions](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gilling+Castle/@54.1832864,-1.0661554,509m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x487ece138b01b4b9:0x545bdca7e27f37f9!8m2!3d54.1835346!4d-1.0655843!16zL20vMGNoNXY2?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)) which is 21 minutes from Kirkbymoorside. In the morning we will pick up some pasties and curd tarts for lunch. We can enjoy a breather after 9 holes!

**The first group tees off at 11am**.

- Group 1: Mike, Harry, Alistair
- Group 2: Sam, Thomas, Appin
- Group 3: Sue, Alan, Jamie

### Handicaps

The Gilling Castle website has a very helpful handicap calculator! So no excuses this year; it's legit! Ali and Pin get two shots per hole.

### Scoring

Anyone with an odd number of shots (Mike and Tom) gets the extra shot on the back nine. This is outrageous as it means Tom gets a shot going up the last. But that is how the scorecard shakes down!

There is a different par for Ladies and Men so this year we're going to have to do **net score to par**. Don't worry, I have [made a handy thing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lvgWl71GMc_8VAHN85Iu9HH5NVwKFuPflPzX-HhyrgI/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to work it all out!

A playoff has the potential to get complicated: we'll use the hole's stroke index and the player's handocap to calculate their **net** score.

Ties at halfway will be on hole-by-hole countback. Again we might need stroke index (net score to par via last hole, working back to first hole).

### Trophy presentation

Will take place directly after the close of play at The Fairfax Arms, Gilling East, which is 0.5 miles from the golf course.

### Dinner

Is booked for 19:30 (thank you Thomas!) at The Moors in Appleton ([directions]()) which is 7 minutes from Kirkbymoorside (or 24 minutes from The Fairfax Arms)
