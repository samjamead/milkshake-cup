## The spirit of the cup is alive and well!

In the words of defending champion Harry P. Langdon:

import AnnualWelcome from '@/components/annual-welcome'

import defendingChamp from '../2023/photos/theChamp.jpeg'

<AnnualWelcome name='Harry Langdon' year='2024' image={defendingChamp}>
  The Milkshake Cup has shown each year that it can only be won by the person
  whose soul objective is to have fun. So the question is &ndash; how badly do
  you not want to win it? <br /> <br /> Good luck out there... this could be our
  best yet!
</AnnualWelcome>

Oh, so much of Harry's address would prove to be prophetic. It _was_ our best yet, it _was_ won by the golfer with the most soul, and the eventual champ was adamant, absolutely adamant, that he did not want to win it!

But before we get into all that, let us rewind to our second entry to Lions Day. We were welcomed like long lost brothers and sisters, recognised as soon as we strode out of the car park, and ushered inside to part with our hard earned cash.

**Cream First** (Appin, Jamie, Tom, Walshy) welcomed in...

Believe it or not, I wrote all that 11 months ago, but it doesn't look like I got very far.
