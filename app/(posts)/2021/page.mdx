<AnnualWelcome name='Samuel Smith' year='2020' image={defendingChamp}>
  The Milkshake Cup. It's more than a competition, it's a tradition. Those lucky
  enough to receive an invite know what it means. To win the cup? What a dream.
  Just to participate is an honour. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's the only time my
  wife lets me go swinging. May the fairways be fair, the greens be green and
  the smiles be ear to ear. All the best... FORE!
</AnnualWelcome>

I'm terribly sorry, everyone, but in the last 13 months (the 2022 edition will be played exactly one year and one month after the 2021 edition) I seem to have forgotten more or less everything I had jotted down for the match report…

Fortunately, the cajoling words of a friendly Scot that we bumped into on arrival are forever embedded in my mind:

> Ah, you're all heading out to play, are you? Well good luck, the greens are shite and there's water everywhere. The game's a bogey!

I can only hope for Jock's sake that Stuart didn't overhear such slander - and I'm sure the greens were as excellent as ever!

From [the photos](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPcWE_7G2ODDA_q0UZbvSdzZFM7OqyWzlAbFRrIjV0hGJu2azn7Quir_HNtVVfiTQ?key=S1RocjZoc2xpdkt0ZFIxbTJ5b2lQM0FhSk5PUTl3) (thank you Samuel, fab work behind the camera) it does look like we started in coats but finished in glorious Devon sunshine. I have another half memory that collectively we smashed the record for birdies in a Milkshake Cup, and by some margin! Harry birdied the 8th on both rounds, and Pin threw a dart into the treacherous 6th to join the twos club in style:

Maybe this year I really, truly, actually will get around to writing this shortly after the Milky C, rather than shortly before…
